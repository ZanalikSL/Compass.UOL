# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Used Stuff

- React
- Sass
- react-router-dom
- github API

### A little more about the project

Not all the requested requirements have been implemented.
It took me much longer on the CSS than I expected. The next steps I expected to do was to implement the Storybooks, perform the tests and after that make the connection with the weather API.

As I have already requested more time, I will deliver what I have in hands.
